### Hi there 👋

- 🙋🏼‍♂️ Hi there! My name is Barry (not other Barry) and I'm a hobby programmer.
- 📚 The last couple years I started taking an interest in data and data-analysis. 
    I have been using Excel (or Apple Numbers) for insight in my personal finances for a while now but realized that I wanted 
    to be able to do more than fiddle with formulas and pivot tables. 
- 🐍 So, I started learning Python a couple months ago!
- 💽 And I've just released my very first app, CalYrDiv. Check it out!
- 💡 Currently working on new features to add to CalYrDiv and thinking of new projects (and of course learning more about Python).
- 📬 Reach me at barryspecial@posteo.nl if you have any questions, feedback or ideas on how to improve my app(s).
