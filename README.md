### Hi there 👋

- 🙋🏼‍♂️ Hi there! My name is Barry (not my real name) and I'm a hobby programmer.
- 📚 The last couple years I started taking an interest in data and data-analysis. 
    I have been using Excel (or Apple Numbers) for insight in my personal finances for a while now but realized that I wanted 
    to be able to do more than fiddle with formulas and pivot tables. 
- 🐍 So, I started learning Python in 2023!
- 💽 I've released my very first app, CalYrDiv in September. Check it out!
- 🌐 Meanwhile I've been working on my own website, learning about HTML and CSS.
- 💡 Currently working on my website and thinking of new projects (and of course learning more about Python/HTML/CSS on the go).
- 📬 Reach me at barryspecial@posteo.nl if you have any questions, feedback or ideas on how to improve my app(s).
